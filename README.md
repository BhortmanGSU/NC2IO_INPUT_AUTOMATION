# NC2IO_INPUT_AUTOMATION
A simple python script for automating the loading of NDI Sources into Newtek devices. (NC1IO and NC2IO tested) 

I dont think there are any requirements other than Python. Im using 3.11.8 (Microsoft Store) 

I think it will likely work with any Newtek device, but I havent tested it yet. 

Replace the IP addresses and use NDI Anaylsis.exe from newtek to find the names of your sources and then copy them into the code with a VSC or Notepad++
